		Family Info
	</h2>
	<p style="text-align:top;font-family:verdana">
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a really nice family. I am the oldest out of four children. My mom and dad are very hard-working. I know this because my mom is a teacher and my dad is auto mechanic. They both work and have very stable jobs. My other siblings are Chloe, Ellie, and Timothy. We get along pretty well nowadays. I often hear about how siblings hate and hit one another, but that has not happened in a long time. I guess that is a good thing.
