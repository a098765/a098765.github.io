				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My religion is Christianity. I go to San Jose Christian Alliance Church. 
				It is a great church. I am part of the Youth Servant Leadership and is in charge of the Audio and Visual part. 
				I really like serving and helping out at church. The people at church are really nice and friendly. They are very hospitable is a way to put it. I also teach Sunday School to the Pre-K and Kindergarten kids. They are very cute and teaching is fun and difficult. I really enjoy going to church. My church website is  <a href=”http://www.sjcacdev2.dreamhosters.com/”>here</a>

				Chores
				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:top;font-family:verdana">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two main chores. Which is taking out the trash and vacuuming/steaming. I will be call when the my parents need the trash taken out. I also have to vacuum, but not as regularly as throwing out trash. I now have to mop less because my mom bought this automatic mopping robot. It is like the Roomba but it mops. I still need to set it up and clean the rag afterwards, but it is a lot easier than  steam mopping.
