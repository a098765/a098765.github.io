				My Future Plans
			</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left;font-family:verdana">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have recentlly thought more of the future. For my collage, I would like to be accepted by UC Berkely. That is my dream collage. I know it will be hard to get in to, but still I will like to go there. The more cost efficent way to go to collage for me is going to UC Davis. My family owns a house in Sacramento, so housing would be a taken care of. 
				For my job I would like to work at NASA. I really enjoy how advanced is the technology and would like to help out addance space exploration.

				My Bed
			</h2>
			<p style="text-align:left;font-family:verdana">
				My bed is a very important place that I spend a lot of time in. I have the top part of a bunk bed as the frame of my bed. I have a collection of small balls on the headboard shelf. 
				I also have a mini dwarer under the collection. I have random stuff in there, such as pens, red envelopes, and fake credit cards. I recently got a heated mattress topper which makes my bed really warm. Though I like it very much, it make getting out of bed harder. I have one main blanket and two smaller, thiner blankets that I use if it get too cold at night.
